This utilizes Cloud Shell Tutorials to provide the instructions for the Apigee Fundamentals API Jam

## Prerequisites

You have already started Apigee API Jam Lab 1: API Management Fundamentals from explore.qwiklabs.com and signed into your temporary Qwiklabs GCP account

## Launch guide from Cloud Shell

If you wish for your API Jam guide to display directly within the GCP console: 

1. **Right click** the below button and select **Open Link in Incognito Window**

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.png)](https://console.cloud.google.com?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/apigeek3000/api-jam-fundamentals-cloud-shell&cloudshell_git_branch=main&cloudshell_workspace=.&cloudshell_tutorial=cloud-shell-tutorial.md)

2. In the tab that opens, agree to trust this repo and open in Cloud Shell

3. Once Cloud Shell finishes opening the tutorial, close the Cloud Shell editor by clicking the X button. Be sure that you don't mistakenly close the tutorial sidebar

4. Be sure that you are in the GCP project specified by Qwiklabs. Follow the instructions in the tutorial sidebar

Note: You will still need to check your progress using the guide in explore.qwiklabs.com
